# dotfiles

Set up dotfiles in my mac.  
It is highly recommended to use this shell after [MyMac](https://github.com/aha-oretama/MyMac)'s shell.

## How to use
```bash
$ curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -fsSL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aha-oretama/dotfiles/master/install.sh' | bash
```

If you want to overrite dotfiles which exists from the beginning, use following command.
```bash
$ curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' -fsSL 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aha-oretama/dotfiles/master/install.sh' | bash -s -- -f
```
